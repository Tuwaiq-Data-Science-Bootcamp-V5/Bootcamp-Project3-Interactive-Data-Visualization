## Introduction:
The goal of our project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of a dataset containing over 50k villas in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Our objectives include exploring patterns, identifying key features, and creating an interactive dashboard for insightful visualizations.

## Dataset Overview and Source:
- **Dataset:** Riyadh_Villas_Data.csv
- **Source:** The dataset comprises information on villas in Riyadh, including location, neighborhood, bedrooms, bathrooms, space, and more.

## Describe the final ten insights.
- PRICE BASED ON LOCATIONS:
This map represents real estate prices in Riyadh areas, as the largest circle represents the most expensive area.
- AVG.PRICES FOR SOME CAPITAL CITIES:
In this map, we selected random capitals around the world and compared their average real estate prices.
- PRICES BASED ON PROPERTY AGE:
This graph represents the relationship between the age of the property and its price, as the newer the property is, the higher its price.
- PRICES OF VILLAS BASED ON DRIVER ROOM AND SPACES:
This graph shows that there is a relationship between space and the driverâ€™s room, and they together affect the price of the property.
- MAX.SPACE BASED ON LOCATIONS:
This circle shows the largest real estate in Riyadh areas, and compares them.
- MIN.SPACE BASED ON LOCATIONS:
This circle shows the smallest real estate in Riyadh areas, and compares them.
- AVG.PROPERTY AGE BASED ON LOCATIONS:
It is clear to us here that the oldest properties in Riyadh are located in the central Riyadh area, and the reason this average is affected is that central Riyadh has the largest number of older villas compared to the number of old villas in the rest of Riyadh.
- NUMBER OF ROOMS BASED ON LOCATIONS:
Here we see the number of rooms based on the area (location). Each circle has a different color based on the number of rooms. The size of the circle represents the count of properties that contain that number of rooms.
- PRICES BASED ON ELEVATOR:
We see in this chart that the price of the property is affected by the presence of an elevator.
- SQUARE PRICE BASED ON SPACE:
Here we can see the difference of the square price depending on the space and location, the location affects the square price with a noticeable difference.
