## Introducton

This project focuses on analyzing the Riyadh Aqar dataset, specifically examining dublex and villa properties. The dataset has been cleaned and visualized using Seaborn Plotly and Tableau.

## Dataset

The Riyadh Aqar dataset contains information about various properties in Riyadh, including their type, location, area, price, and other relevant details.

### Data Cleaning

The dataset was subjected to a cleaning process to ensure data integrity and remove any inconsistencies or missing values. The cleaning steps included:

- Removing duplicate entries
- Handling missing values
- Correcting data types

## Visualizations

The cleaned dataset was visualized using Seaborn Plotly and Tableau to gain insights and communicate the findings effectively.

### Plotly

Plotly, a Python visualization library, was utilized to create interactive and visually appealing plots. The following types of charts were used:

- Scatter plots
- Bar charts
- Violin plots
- Pie charts
- Heatmaps

### Tableau

Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool, was employed to create informative and visually appealing dashboards. The dashboards include:

- Overview of property types and their distribution
- Price d5istribution across different areas in Riyadh
- Comparison of property prices by type and location

## Insights 

- We noticed that the price of propertys in the north of riyadh is too high compared to other regions.

## Conclusion

By leveraging the power of Plotly and Tableau, we created interactive and informative visualizations. These visualizations provided a deeper understanding of property types, price distributions, and comparisons across different areas in Riyadh. The visual representations allowed us to communicate our findings effectively and support data-driven decision-making.
